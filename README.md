# Configuration for .gitignore

Copy the code of gitignore.txt and create the archive in the paste of your project

(important) to add this .gitignore it is recommended that you never have initialized the local project as a repository, because if already versioned, it will not work unless you use the git rm -r --cached command <file> in each file, or delete the .git folder (not recommended).
